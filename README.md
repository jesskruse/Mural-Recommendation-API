# About

This API uses a CSV export from an activity in Mural to recommend content on an e-mentoring platform. The API creates a more portable JSON structure to store the information relevant to the recommendation functionality.

> [!note]
> The purpose of this project is to demonstrate portable information structures. Only portions of code are functional.
